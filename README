This texture pack aims to create a Commodore 64 8-bit style environment for 
Minetest.  All images herein are hand-drawn, based on the overall style 
used in my photorealistic packs (but of course limited to what a C64 
could theoretically display).

Put the Vanessa_* folder wherever you want to keep your texture packs, 
and edit ~/.minetest/minetest.conf to point to it.
